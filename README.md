## Introduction
This repository explores the fascinating question of imitation capabilities across different models. We investigate various approaches to motion imitation and evaluate their effectiveness in replicating complex human movements. Our work provides insights into the fundamental differences between imitation learning paradigms.

## P2P-Motion
Our novel Peer-to-Peer Motion (P2P-Motion) framework establishes a new benchmark in imitation learning. Key features include:
- Real-time motion transfer between heterogeneous agents
- Adaptive spatial-temporal alignment
- Bidirectional imitation capability
- Robustness to morphological differences
